Big fun of data analysis, data visualization, programming,
mathematical statistics, large collider detectors and experiments, data taking, 
scientific publishing. 

### More Information

I used to do particle physics at CERN. Now I am getting more and more curious 
about the ongoing digital transformations sneaking, mainly implicitly, 
into our every-day lives.
Have you watched anything about 'Industry 4.0', or ' ongoing Industrial Revolution',
even on your favorite local TV channel already? Do we take all this seriously?
It can be considered just as unnecessary hype, but many industrial giants
promise a real breakthrough in the field of Aritficial intelligence very
soon. Data science, knowledge mining, machine learning, whatever you call
it, is developing very rapidly. On one hand it is not easy to catch up, but
on the other Cloud services and high quality software frameworks 
are available to many already today...
