Big fun of data analysis, data visualization, programming,
mathematical statistics, large collider detectors and experiments, data taking, 
scientific publishing. 

### More Information

I used to do particle physics at CERN. Now I am getting more and more curious 
about the ongoing Industrial Revolution (have you watched anything about
'Industry 4.0' on TV already?) and desperately trying to get prepared
for this. Python, R, C++ as well as numerous frameworks 
based on them seem indispensable...
