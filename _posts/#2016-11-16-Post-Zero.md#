title: ML competition: first try / 2016-11-16

The Russian biggest bank, Sberbank, does want to seize the 
opportunities and benefit from the ongoing transformations 
in the field of digital technologies. How do we know it?
The bank started to organize machine learning competitions,
(direct comparisons to Kaggle are unavoidable but probably
not fully relevant). This time everything
was really nicely organized and nicely called as a
'Sberbank Data Science Journey' including 
'Data Science Contest', 'Startup Challenge', 
'Data Science Day'. The record of the online broadcast
can be watched if you follow the

(almost 8 hours they speak Russian).



My aim was rather simple: develop solutions a bit better than
the baseline. Overall I succeeded qualifying in the 1st roughly
30% of participants. Well, let us take it as a success ;)
