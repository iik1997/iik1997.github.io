I have visited a machine learning 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Rhein-Neckar/events/235015220/)
at Heidelberg Uni a couple of days ago.
There was an interesting and revealing presentation on 'sentiment analysis' 
using different Neural Network architectures. During a lively discussion
a question came up 'Which book to read?' to learn the fundamentals behind
the Neural Nets.

I have no doubts one can dig plenty of such lists in the internet.
Still I cannot help compiling my own list of materpieces on the 
machine learning:

* Christopher M. Bishop (Microsoft), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2006
* Ian Goodfellow (OpenAI), Yoshua Bengio (UMontreal), Aaron Courville (UMontreal), Deep Learning, 
MIT (to be published in 2016, available online http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* Gareth James (UCLA), Daniela Witten (UWashington), Trevor Hastie (UStanford), 
Robert Tibshirani (UStanford), An Introduction to
Statistical Learning with Applications in R (aka ISL), 
Springer, 2013 (Corrected at 6th printing 2015)
* Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman (UStanford),
The Elements of
Statistical Learning
Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction
(aka ESL), Springer, 2010 (2nd edition)
* Kevin P. Murphy (Google), Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective,
MIT, 2012
* Daphne Koller (UStanford, Coursera founder) and Nir Friedman (UJerusalem), 
Probabilistic Graphical Models Principles and Techniques,
MIT, 2009
* Stuart Russell (UCBerkeley) and Peter Norvig (Director of Research at Google), 
Artificial Itelligence A Modern Approach, 
Pearson, 2010

For people thinking about getting a certificate this may be interesting:

* EMC Education Services, Data Science & Big Data Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, 
Visualizing and Presenting Data, Wiley, 2015

And besides all the masterpieces, a book I like in particular:

* Ethem AlpaydÄ±n (Istanbul), Introduction to Machine Learning,
MIT, 2010 (2nd edition)
