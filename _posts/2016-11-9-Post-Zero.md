I have visited a machine learning 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Rhein-Neckar/events/235015220/)
at Heidelberg Uni a couple of days ago.
There was an interesting and revealing presentation on 'sentiment analysis' 
using different Neural Network architectures. During a lively discussion
a question came up 'Which book to read?' to learn the fundamentals behind
the Neural Nets.

I have no doubts one can dig plenty of such lists in the internet.
Still I cannot help compiling my own list of materpieces on the 
machine learning.

* Christopher M. Bishop (Microsoft), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2006
* Ian Goodfellow (OpenAI), Yoshua Bengio (UMontreal), Aaron Courville (UMontreal), Deep Learning, 
MIT (to be published in 2016, available online http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
