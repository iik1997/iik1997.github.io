I have visited a machine learning 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Machine-Learning-Rhein-Neckar/events/235015220/)
at Heidelberg Uni a couple of days ago.
There was an interesting and revealing presentation on 'sentiment analysis' 
using different Neural Network architectures.
At some point we found ourselves discussing 'what to read?'
to learn the fundamentals behind
the Neural Nets.

I have no doubts one can dig plenty of such lists in the internet.
Still I cannot help compiling my own list of materpieces on 
machine learning:

* Christopher M. Bishop (Microsoft), Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Springer, 2006
* Ian Goodfellow (OpenAI), Yoshua Bengio (UMontreal), Aaron Courville (UMontreal), Deep Learning, 
MIT (to be published in 2016, available online http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* Gareth James (UCLA), Daniela Witten (UWashington), Trevor Hastie (UStanford), 
Robert Tibshirani (UStanford), An Introduction to
Statistical Learning with Applications in R (aka ISL), 
Springer, 2013 (Corrected at 6th printing 2015)
* Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman (UStanford),
The Elements of
Statistical Learning:
Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction
(aka ESL), Springer, 2010 (2nd edition)
* Kevin P. Murphy (Google), Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective,
MIT, 2012
* Daphne Koller (UStanford, Coursera founder) and Nir Friedman (UJerusalem), 
Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques,
MIT, 2009
* Stuart Russell (UCBerkeley) and Peter Norvig (Director of Research at Google), 
Artificial Itelligence: A Modern Approach, 
Pearson, 2010

For people thinking about getting a certificate this may be interesting (the book
includes also chapters on SQL):

* EMC Education Services, Data Science & Big Data Analytics: Discovering, Analyzing, 
Visualizing and Presenting Data, Wiley, 2015

And besides all the masterpieces, a book I like in particular:

* Ethem AlpaydÄ±n (Istanbul), Introduction to Machine Learning,
MIT, 2010 (2nd edition) 

Not only young guys from Russia tend to occupy the top of the Kaggle rating,
theoretical contributions of the older school are also well appreciated:

* Bernhard Schoelkopf et al (Eds.), Empirical Inference:
Festschrift in Honor of Vladimir N. Vapnik, Springer, 2013
