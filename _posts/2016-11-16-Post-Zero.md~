title: ML competition: first try / 2016-11-16
---

The Russian biggest bank, Sberbank, does want to seize the 
opportunities and benefit from the ongoing transformations 
in the field of digital technologies. How do we know it?
The bank started to organize machine learning competitions,
in a similar manner as Kaggle does. This time everything
was really nicely organized 

My aim was rather simple: develop solutions a bit better than
the baseline. Overall I succeeded qualifying in the 1st roughly
30% of participants. Well, let us take it as a success ;)
